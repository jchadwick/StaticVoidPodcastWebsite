Chris, Todd, and Jess welcome their guest Matt Hornsby to discuss a concept he calls "Code Sprawl" to describe the evolution and decay of software systems over time. Relating the growth and aging of a software project to the growth and decay of urban areas, he draws parallels to identify what goes wrong. He also presents hope that we can learn from urban renewal as well. Â  **About our guest** Matt Hornsby is an experienced principal software engineer who has led teams building Internet scale applications such as healthcare exchanges and retail websites that are among the largest in the world. This led Matt to develop a passion for guiding his teams to build maintainable systems and write quality code. **Related Links**
