In this episode, Chris, Todd, and Jess discuss how awesome Visual Studio Code is while Todd defends the relevance of the full-blown Visual Studio "Classic Cadillac" IDE. What's the difference between an "IDE" and the new breed of powerful and extensible "text editors" such as Notepad++, Sublime Text, and now Visual Studio Code. Oh yeah, and Jess gets yet another reason to talk about how great TypeScript is, too. **Show Links**
