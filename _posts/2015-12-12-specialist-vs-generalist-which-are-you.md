In this episode, Jess, Chris, and Todd try to figure out what it means to be a specialist vs. a generalist in software development. Does being a generalist help you be a better specialist... or vice-versa? Can you even be one without the other? Join us as we try (and fail?) to answer these questions and manage to get an episode under one hour long.
