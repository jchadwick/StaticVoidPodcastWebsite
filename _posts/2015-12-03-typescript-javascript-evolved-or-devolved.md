It's TypeScript battle royale style as Jess, Chris and Todd discuss the emergence of TypeScript, ECMAScript 6 and the growth of JavaScript transpilers. Hear Jess promote the benefits of TypeScript for improving the quality of JavaScript and developer productivity. Meanwhile, Chris and Todd take on the competing argument that TypeScript is just syntactic sugar and that add classes and types on top of pure JavaScript can end up being a leaky abstraction that does more harm than good.
