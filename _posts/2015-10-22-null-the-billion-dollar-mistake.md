If you've done any .NET development at all, you've undoubtedly experience the dreaded NullReferenceException. In Java, it's the NullPointException. No matter what you call it, interacting with a null reference in any language can spell disaster for your application. Join Jess, Chris, and Todd as they chat about null values, some of the ways that they deal with them in their own applications, and how they've come to live relatively peacefully in a world full of nulls.
