In this episode, Todd, Chris, and Jess embrace the holiday spirit and share the stories that have molded them into the hardened code slingers they are today. Did Chris actually meet the real, live Batman while on a job in the middle of the night in Disneyland? Will Jess ever actually get fired - or even scolded - for deleting production databases and bringing production websites to a grinding halt? Why does Todd carry around 4 laptop power adapters to this day? Listen to our stories and decide for yourself.
