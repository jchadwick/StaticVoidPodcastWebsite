What does "DevOps" really mean when you're not up on stage demoing the latest DevOps product or working at Netflix, Etsy, or Facebook? To find out, we ask [Andy Schwam](http://www.schwammysays.net/) ([@schwammy](https://twitter.com/schwammy)), a development manager, architect, and coder who has lived and breathed the concepts of "DevOps" in the real world... and lived to tell about it. What's myth and what works? What's hard and what's easy? Andy takes us behind the scenes and tells us what it takes to transform an existing error-prone manual deployment to a highly-reliable, repeatable, and automated process.
