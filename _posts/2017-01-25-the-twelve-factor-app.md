Join Jess, Todd, and Chris as they discuss ["The Twelve-Factor App"](https://12factor.net/): a set of patterns and practices that are crucial to building modern, scalable, and "cloud-ready" applications. The 12 Factors will help you build web applications that:

*   Use **declarative** formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
*   Have a **clean contract** with the underlying operating system, offering **maximum portability** between execution environments;
*   Are suitable for **deployment** on modern **cloud platforms**, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
*   **Minimize divergence** between development and production, enabling **continuous deployment** for maximum agility;
*   And can **scale up** without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

**Show Links:**

*   **[The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)**: The site that started it all
*   **[Beyond the Twelve-Factor App](https://content.pivotal.io/ebooks/beyond-the-12-factor-app)**: (free eBook) The follow-up book that expands on the original 12 Factors and adds some great real-world advice
