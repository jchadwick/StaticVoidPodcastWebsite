Chris, Jess, and Todd chat about enterprise messaging patterns. Is it a good practice to put a message bus or a queue in between your web server and your middle tier services? Can message buses be overkill? What's the best way for your loosely-coupled containerized services to communicate with one another? Did Todd actually say that there's some benefits to building a monolith? We asked all these questions, but you've got to listen to see how many of them we actually answered... or how many answers we actually got right.
