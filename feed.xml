      <content:encoded><![CDATA[In anticipation of the up-coming .NET Core 2.0 release (and the preview currently available), Todd, Jess, and Chris offer their answers to some of the frequently asked questions around .NET Core, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Does .NET Core 2.0 have all the namespaces/APIs as .NET 4.6?</li>
 	<li>Does .NET Core support Visual Basic (VB.NET) yet?</li>
 	<li>What about SignalR - is that available?</li>
 	<li>What options do I have when running my ASP.NET Core applications?  Do I have to use IIS?  What about Docker?</li>
 	<li>What is .NET Standard (and should I care)?</li>
 	<li>What's the best IDE to use when building an ASP.NET Core application?</li>
</ul>
And, of course…
<ul>
 	<li>Should I start moving from .NET 4.6 to .NET Core now?  Is it ready for prime time?</li>
</ul>

The 12 Factors will help you build web applications that:
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>declarative</strong> formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;</li>

<li>Have a <strong>clean contract</strong> with the underlying operating system, offering <strong>maximum portability</strong> between execution environments;</li>

<li>Are suitable for <strong>deployment</strong> on modern <strong>cloud platforms</strong>, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;</li>

<li><strong>Minimize divergence</strong> between development and production, enabling <strong>continuous deployment</strong> for maximum agility;</li>

<li>And can <strong>scale up</strong> without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[NuGet burst onto the .NET developer scene in 2010 and took Visual Studio development by storm.  We .NET developers were able to easily add key Microsoft dependencies like Entity Framework, ASP.NET Web API, or client-side libraries like jQuery and bootstrap.

But now new package management is front and center in Visual Studio 2015.  And there's nothing stopping you from using them in your development toolbelt today.  Where does this leave NuGet?  And what will you need to get up to speed on now?

Chris, Todd, and Jess talk about what NuGet meant to developers until now, and introduce NPM and Bower and their integration into the ASP.NET 5 beta templates.  By no means is it the whole list of package managers you can use, but they will be front and center for web developers who live in Visual Studio.
